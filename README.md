# About Me

Hello, everyone from Planet Earth, I am here to tell you about me.

- I am not a Developer, while I can do some coding.
- I am not a Monkey, while I feel myself more Monkey than Human.
- I love to write, to read, to think about what I read, and write about it again.
- As you can see, I am a bit repetitive. 
- All words that I think I know, like this ones you read, I copy from someone.
- I don't believe they will ask me to pay the rights to use this words that, they copy from someone, or else, we would have a Eternal problem, in how we could communicate. 
- I like Music. All kinds of Music. 
- I like Books. All kinds of Books.
- I Like Animals. All kind of Animals. 
- I like you, because you are an animal. :) 
- I have some sense of humor, while speaking about what is "True". 
- I am the author of OdicforceSounds.com sub-domains.

- I like Taoism / Daoism.
- I like to see the Creativity, that is in You and in me.
- I like the human ability to Imagine and to Create
- Sometimes I don't like, what humans do with their Unique **Divine** characteristics that all have. 
- Without it, nothing would ever change, nothing could ever be created.
- In Chinese interpretation, Monkeys are always offensive, while they are peaceful.
- Outside China, many are silent, while demonstrating being destructive. 
- Maybe is a coincidence. :) 

I am working on this project, explained in the **wiki** and others audio-tracks, like music **Social Tool Kit** from the album **Emotional Signals** and the music **The Challenge** from the album **Spiritual Algorithm**, to be possible to create an Android application to be used by children and older persons.
