# About Me

Hello, everyone from Planet Earth. If You are an ET, I welcome you too! :) 

- I am not a Developer, while I can do some coding.
- I am not a Monkey, while I feel myself more Monkey than Human.
- I love to write, to read, to think about what I read, and write about it again.
    - As you can see, I am a bit repetitive. 
    - All words that I think I know, like this ones you read, I copy from someone.
    - I don't believe they will ask me to pay the rights to use this words that, they copy from someone, or else, we would have a Eternal problem, in how we could communicate. 
- Appreciate what is new, Enjoy what is old like it was new. 
    - I like Music. All kinds of Music. 
    - I like Books. All kinds of Books.
    - I Like Animals. All kind of Animals. 
    - I like you, because you are an animal. :) 
    - I have some sense of humor, while speaking about what is "True". 
- I am the author of OdicforceSounds.com sub-domains.

- I like Taoism / Daoism.
    - I like to see the Creativity, that is in You and in me.
    - I like the human ability to Imagine and to Create
- Sometimes I don't like, what humans do with their Unique **Divine** characteristics that all have.
    - Without it, nothing would ever change, nothing could ever be created.
    - In Chinese interpretation, Monkeys are always offensive, while they are peaceful.
    - Outside China, many are silent, while demonstrating being destructive.
    - Maybe is a coincidence, because Chinese can be silent, while demonstrating being in Peace.
- "Everything you will  say, can be used against you in Court."
    - The Criminals believe in the same, but they don't make of use of Courts.
    - This is the common aspect between Legal-Justice and Illegal-Justice. 
- In this world, we can teach to give the opportunity to others, become better. 
    - Many prefer to Judge, when they could teach.
    - Many children were target of violent penalties, for doing something wrong.
    - What Should I do when non-children do mistakes?
    - I dont' know, but I keep trying to Teach.
- The beauty of contradictions of Yin and Yang, associated to God and the Devil. 
    - One day a "Good Men" create something. 
    - In the next day a "Bad Men", deny the "Good Men" creation. 
    - The "Good", become bad, because did react in a violent way, against who deny his will. 
    - The "Bad" become good, because it was victimized in a vilent way, by who should know how to deal with those who deny. 
    - This days, we can see so many stories like this. 
    - People reacting in a violent way, to those who deny their will.
- I don't like the military, when the objective is destructive. 
    - They learn to accept orders, without questioning them. 
    - They cannot deny them, or else, they will be punished. 
    - I don't know who love those systems, but I see that many do.
    - Maybe God is there, trying to be happy with those who don't deny his will. 
- God is Good but kill us all, the Devil is Bad but make us Laugth.
    - I am sure that the "Devil" is the Guardian of Paradise.
    - The one who knows, who is Good or Bad, because God can be Mad. 
    

I am working on this project, explained in the **wiki** and others audio-tracks, like music **Social Tool Kit** from the album **Emotional Signals** and the music **The Challenge** from the album **Spiritual Algorithm**, to be possible to create an Android application to be used by children and older persons.
