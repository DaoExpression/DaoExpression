# About Me

Hello, everyone from Planet Earth. If You are an ET, I welcome you too! :) 

- I am not a Developer, while I can do some coding.
- I am not a Monkey, while I feel myself more Monkey than Human.
- I love to write, to read, to think about what I read, and write about it again.
    - As you can see, I am a bit repetitive. 
    - All words that I think I know, like this ones you read, I copy from someone.
    - I don't believe they will ask me to pay the rights to use this words that, they copy from someone, or else, we would have a Eternal problem, in how we could communicate. 
- Appreciate what is new, Enjoy what is old like it was new. 
    - I like Music. All kinds of Music. 
    - I like Books. All kinds of Books.
    - I Like Animals. All kind of Animals. 
    - I like you, because you are an animal. :) 
    - I have some sense of humor, while speaking about what is "True". 
- I am the author of OdicforceSounds.com sub-domains.

    - And somewhere is Time, I will have the app.OdicforceSounds.com 
- I like Taoism / Daoism.
    - I like to see the Creativity, that is in You and in me.
    - I like the human ability to Imagine and to Create
- Sometimes I don't like, what humans do with their Unique **Divine** characteristics that all have.
    - Without it, nothing would ever change, nothing could ever be created.
    - In Chinese interpretation, Monkeys are always offensive, while they are peaceful.
    - Outside China, many are silent, while demonstrating being destructive.
    - Maybe is a coincidence, because Chinese can be silent, while demonstrating being in Peace.
- "Everything you will  say, can be used against you in Court."
    - The Criminals believe in the same, but they don't make of use of Courts.
    - This is the common aspect between Legal-Justice and Illegal-Justice.
    - The only way to do Justice, is to be Evil.
    - Else, we can only teach, to change the choice of those who make wrong choices, while doing the wrong choices, lead us to learn fast.
    - Humans can only learn by doing mistakes.
    - Humans can learn by reading, while the thinker will not do anything with what  the thinker knows. 
- In this world, we can teach to give the opportunity to others, to become better.
    - Many prefer to Judge, when they could teach.
    - Many children were target of violent penalties, for doing something wrong.
    - What Should I do when non-children do mistakes?
    - I dont' know, but I keep trying to Teach.
- The beauty of contradictions of Yin and Yang, associated to God and the Devil.
    - One day a "Good Men" create something.
    - In the next day a "Bad Men", deny the "Good Men" creation.
    - The "Good", become bad, because did react in a violent way, against who deny his will.
    - The "Bad" become good, because it was victimized in a vilent way, by who should know how to deal with those who deny.
    - This days, we can see so many stories like this.
    - People reacting in a violent way, to those who deny their will.
- I don't like the military, when the objective is destructive.
    - They learn to accept orders, without questioning them.
    - They cannot deny them, or else, they will be punished.
    - I don't know who love those systems, but I see that many do.
    - Maybe God is there, trying to be happy with those who don't deny his will.
- God is Good but kill us all, the Devil is Bad but make us Laugth.
    - I am sure that the "Devil" is the Guardian of Paradise.
    - The one who knows, who is Good or Bad, because God can be Mad.
- All Religious books are like books-for-children.
    - They try to teach some basic values.
    - They try to inform you about humans events.
    - Sadly many readers, don't think about what they read.
    - Sadly, most known religious books, become like "technical books"
        - People believe that what those books describe is God will, but for everything that Human create, is Human will, not God. God cannot write books, humans can.
    - Everything I describe is my sites, are about **The Style of God**, while the Style is not God.
    - My style is to create creative content, while trying to teach.
        - I am not a teacher and my composition is not made of letters.
- There is a Room with one single Paint in the wall.
    - We ask 5 persons to describe this Paint using text.
    - At the end, we have 5 different descriptions of the same paint.
    - Question: How many paints are in this room?
- So many books that describe God. 
    - So many groups compiting about which Book is True.
    - So many groups denying others interpretations of the same "object".
    - Maybe they don't wish to learn, while they love to compite.
    - "My book speak about the Truth, not yours, Both say".
- I think people have some children inside, while that is not bad to the mind.
- What contradicts with Pleasure? 
    - Love: If you love, you are living happy. Don't be mistaken, Love is not Happiness. 
    - To those who have children and Love them, how many sacrifices you need to do? 
    - I am sure that those sacrifices, did not give you Pleasure. 
    - Love ask dedication, persistence, we need to deny what we wish for us, to make the ones we love, happy. And if you make them happy, you will feel happy. 
    - Only in that moment, you feel pleasure. Because the ones you love are good,  not because you had an orgasm. 
- God gave us the **Free Will of Choice**. So each one make choices. 
    - God don't care if humanity, kill each others for eternity or make sex compulsivly, while doing sex, is more productive, even if the objective is not to make children.

You are the Wood(America) - I am the Fire(Asia): Which means? 

I am working on this project, explained in the **wiki** and others audio-tracks, like music **Social Tool Kit** from the album **Emotional Signals** and the music **The Challenge** from the album **Spiritual Algorithm**, to be possible to create an Android application to be used by children and older persons.
